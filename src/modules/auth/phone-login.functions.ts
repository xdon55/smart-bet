/**
 * auth/phone-login.functions.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Lets a player sign in with their PHONE NUMBER instead of their email.
 *
 * A phone number is not an email address, so Supabase Auth cannot check it on its
 * own (native phone auth needs the Phone provider enabled, which normally means
 * an SMS gateway). Instead:
 *
 *   1. the browser sends { phone, password } here;
 *   2. `resolve_phone_login()` (SECURITY DEFINER, see
 *      supabase/migrations/20260101000500_phone_login.sql) looks the account up by
 *      normalised phone number and verifies the typed password against GoTrue's
 *      own bcrypt hash with pgcrypto's crypt();
 *   3. only on success does it return the account email — a wrong password, an
 *      unknown number and a number shared by two accounts all return nothing, and
 *      attempts are throttled per phone number;
 *   4. the browser then calls supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })
 *      with the email it just resolved, so GoTrue verifies the password a second
 *      time and issues the session exactly as it does for email sign-in.
 *
 * Returning the email is not a disclosure: the caller already had to know the
 * password to get it, and with the password they could sign in anyway.
 *
 * NOTE ON CREDENTIALS: the password passes through this server function (it has to,
 * to be verified against the hash). It is used only for that check, never logged,
 * never stored, and never sent anywhere except Supabase's own auth endpoint.
